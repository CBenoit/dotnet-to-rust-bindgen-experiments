# cbindgen & ClangSharp experiment

Rust side C-compatible API is written by hand, then C headers and raw C# bindings are generated using tools,
and finally idiomatic wrapper is written manually.

## Native library build

Build is as simple as:

```
$ cargo build -p picky-c-api
```

or

```
$ cargo build -p picky-c-api --release
```

Binary will be generated inside `target` folder located at workspace root.

## C header

C header is located in the `./include/` folder.
It is autogenerated using [`cbindgen`](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen/blob/master/docs.md).

## C# .NET bindings

C# .NET bindings are located in the `./dotnet/` folder.

The raw interface is autogenerated from the C header using
Microsoft's [`ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator`](https://github.com/microsoft/ClangSharp).
The tool may be installed [from NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClangSharpPInvokeGenerator/) using `dotnet tool install` command.

## Justfile

A [justfile](https://github.com/casey/just) is provided to run common commands useful at developement time.

Commands for generating the bindings are issued with

```
$ just bindings
```

and sanity tests are run with

```
$ just test
```
